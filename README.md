## How to Run

Run the program by using the following:

`python zelda_MM_soundboard.py`


## Stage of the Project

This project was initially created in the summer of 2017, and currently requires improvements.

As a first-year computer science student, we did not dive into python GUI. However, I was really interested in programming a GUI project, and hence decided to pursuit it myself in the summer.

#### Improvements to be Made

Feedback for the users still needs to be added. Users should be able to know which instrument is currently selected, or which song is currently playing. This can be achieved by having the current selected button be highlighted.

The pace at which each note of the provided songs are played must be adjusted to follow the correct melody.

The design of the interface, including colors and fonts, could be improved.
